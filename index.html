        <p> </p>
        <p class="lead">I am a senior at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/" class="link-primary">University of Waterloo</a> studying Computer Science with a specialization in Human-Computer Interaction. I am deeply interested in product management and embedded backend development. I am currently working as a Product Development Intern at <a href="https://www.ford.ca/">Ford Motor Company</a>. I am passionate about using my technical knowledge to craft innovative and inspiring products that enhance the human experience. I spent the winter working as a Product Management Intern at <a href="https://www.tecsys.com/">Tecsys</a> as part of the API team where I was responsible for authoring 30+ user stories for an omnichannel order management system that comprised of 25+ APIs and microservices. I also assisted in writing content marketing materials including this <a href="https://www.tecsys.com/blog/how-rest-apis-can-provide-an-amazon-like-customer-experience">piece</a> which highlights the advantages of using Tecsys APIs for supply chain management. Before that, I was a Technical Product Manager at <a href="https://autocate.ca/" class="link-primary">AutoCate</a> where I was responsible for planning, developing, testing and launching a <a href="https://github.com/vanshajvohra/autocate-dashboard">company dashboard</a> that allows users to log in, sign up, create records and submit a service request. Previously, I also worked as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.ciena.com/">Ciena</a> where I contributed to building Bifrost - a standardized data-driven framework that provides tools for deploying microservices and managing interfaces for the company's packet optical products.

        <p class="lead">My other interests include playing &#127183 poker, &#127946 swimming, &#127947 working out and following almost every sport on the planet - especially football (both &#9917 and &#127944 - believe it or not).
