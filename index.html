        <h1 class="display-4">&#128075 Hey, I'm Vanshaj</h1>
        <p> </p>
        <p class="lead">I am a senior at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/" class="link-primary">University of Waterloo</a> studying Computer Science. I am currently working as a Software Developer intern at <a href="https://www.thescore.com/" class="link-primary">theScore</a>, as a part of their Casino Foundations team where I'm integrating casino games from third-party game providers onto theScore Bet and ESPN Bet platforms. <mark>I am seeking New Grad 2025 opportunities in Software  Engineering and Backend Development</mark>. </p>
        
        <p class="lead"> I am deeply interested in artificial intelligence and backend development. This past summer, I worked as AI Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.ford.ca/">Bespoke Metrics Inc.</a> where I built a high-accuracy, lightweight PDF extraction and semantic search application using Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and Faiss, to expedite data search and retrieval in large forms and documents. </p>
        
        <p class="lead"> I am passionate about using my technical knowledge to craft innovative and inspiring products that enhance the human experience. As a software engineer at <a href="https://www.ford.ca/" class="link-primary">Ford Motor Company</a>, I was given the task of blocking unauthorized apps from launching in Lincoln vehicles' ultrawide dashboards when the vehicle was in Drive. The problem was challenging but I utilized my proficiency in Java and Kotlin to implement the necessary security features. My experience in developing co-op projects, personal side projects, and contributing to large legacy codebases showcases my ability to develop scalable solutions that can be shipped to and used by real-world customers.</p>
          
        <p class="lead">Previously, I have also worked as a Product Management Intern at <a href="https://www.tecsys.com/" class="link-primary">Tecsys Inc</a>, Full Stack Software Engineer at <a href="https://autocate.ca/" class="link-primary">AutoCate</a> and Software Engineering Intern at <a href="https://www.ciena.com/" class="link-primary">Ciena</a>. Check out my &#128221 <a href="#projects">projects</a> below!</p>
        
        <p class="lead">My other interests include playing &#127183 poker, &#127946 swimming, &#127947 working out and following almost every sport on the planet - especially football (both &#9917 and &#127944 - believe it or not). Feel free to shoot me a <a href="https://twitter.com/VanshajVohra">&#128172 message</a> if you want some tips on your Fantasy Team lineup.</p>
